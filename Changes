0.92	Apr 15, 2009
	* Completed documentation for all modules
	* Added test for backwards compatibility to the pre-factory

0.90    May 07, 2009
	* Implemented new parsing engine and called it 
	  Parse::MediaWikiDump::Revisions. Soon it will be replacing

	  compatible so please feel free to test it in your existing utilities
	  and report success and failure to the author.

	  Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages to support it.

  	  a string which is not really a namespace" provided by Amir E. Aharoni.
	* Moved test data into t/ and moved speed_test.pl into examples/
	* Exceedingly complicated functions (parse_head() and parse_page()) are
	  not funny. Added some comments on how to rectify that situation.
	* Tightened up the tests a little bit.

0.50	Jun 27, 2006
	* Added category links parser.
	* Removed all instances of shift() from the code.

0.40	Jun 21, 2006

0.33	Jun 18, 2006
	* Added current_byte and size methods to page dumper.

0.32	Feb 25, 2006
	* Added a line to create a package named Parse::MediaWikiDump so
	  the module will get listed on CPAN search and the cpan command
	  line tool.

0.31	Jan 10, 2006
	* Fix bug 16981 - Parse::MediaWikiDump::page->redirect does not work
	  with redirects that have a : in them.
 	* Fix bug 16981 part two: title with a non-breaking space in it would
	  come through as undefined.

0.30	December 23, 2005
	* the Pages and Links class now both use a method named next() to get
 	  the next record. The old link() and page() methods are retained for
	  now but should be migrated away from as soon as is convenient. 
 	* Added list of dump files that this module can process to the README
	  file.

0.24	December 19, 2005
	* Fixed bug #16616 - the category method only works properly on English
	  language dump files.

	* Fixed email address for author.
	* Fixed omission of namespace method for pages objects in the 
	  documentation.

	* Added some comments to the source code.

0.22	September 15, 2005
	* Created some new and more comprehensive examples.
	* Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages now dies with a specific error 
	  if it is asked to parse a comprehensive (full pages) dump file.
	* Updated Parse::MediaWikiDump::Links to new dump file format.
	* Added tests for Parse::MediaWikiDump::Links.
	* Solved a bug: Expat's current_byte method returns a 32 bit
	  signed integer and the english Wikipedia dumps cause the number to
          wrap; implemented a work around for this. 

0.21	September 10, 2005
	* Improve testing of Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages
	* Fix silly bug related to opening file handle references
	* Found new bug: The links dump format has been changed and the
	  existing code can not parse the new format
   	* Found new bug: comprehensive dump files like 
	  20050909_pages_full.xml.gz cause the stack to grow too large and
	  the module to abort early. 

0.2    September 9, 2005
	* Add tests and test data
