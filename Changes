Revision history for Parse-MediaWikiDump

0.30	December 23, 2005
	* the Pages and Links class now both use a method named next() to get
 	  the next record. The old link() and page() methods are retained for
	  now but should be migrated away from as soon as is convenient. 
 	* Added list of dump files that this module can process to the README
	  file.

0.24	December 19, 2005
	* Fixed bug #16616 - the category method only works properly on English
	  language dump files. 

0.23	December 19, 2005
	* Fixed email address for author.
	* Fixed omission of namespace method for pages objects in the 
	  documentation.
 	* Added limitations section to README.
	* Fixed http://rt.cpan.org bug #16583 - Module dies when parsing 
	  the 20051211 German Wikipedia dump. 
	* Added some comments to the source code.

0.22	September 15, 2005
	* Created some new and more comprehensive examples.
	* Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages now dies with a specific error 
	  if it is asked to parse a comprehensive (full pages) dump file.
	* Updated Parse::MediaWikiDump::Links to new dump file format.
	* Added tests for Parse::MediaWikiDump::Links.
	* Solved a bug: Expat's current_byte method returns a 32 bit
	  signed integer and the english Wikipedia dumps cause the number to
          wrap; implemented a work around for this. 

0.21	September 10, 2005
	* Improve testing of Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages
	* Fix silly bug related to opening file handle references
	* Found new bug: The links dump format has been changed and the
	  existing code can not parse the new format
   	* Found new bug: comprehensive dump files like 
	  20050909_pages_full.xml.gz cause the stack to grow too large and
	  the module to abort early. 

0.2    September 9, 2005
	* Add tests and test data

0.1    September 6, 2005
        * First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
